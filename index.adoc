==== Summary

I am a full-stack senior developer with more than 12 years of experience. +
My areas of expertise and interest are backend development using *Spring/ Spring Boot* technologies (or Java EE) and
frontend development using Typescript (or Javascript) with AngularJS/*Angular 2+*. I am interested in both the design/architecture
phase of a project as well as the development phase. I am also interested in *Devops*, *Continous delivery* and performance tuning.
I consider myself a problem-solver and solution-oriented developer. I like to work in *Agile* teams and co-operating with my colleagues,
sharing knowledge and expertise so as *to provide the best possible result for the customers*.
