My areas of expertise and interest are backend development using *Spring/ Spring Boot* technologies (or Java EE) and
frontend development using Typescript (or Javascript) with AngularJS/*Angular 2+*. I am interested in both the design/architecture
phase of a project as well as the development phase. +
I am also interested in Devops, Continous delivery and performance tuning. +
I am always eager to learn new technologies and constantly getting informed for new trends,
trying to find new ways to make the day-to-day work faster and more efficient for me and my team. +
